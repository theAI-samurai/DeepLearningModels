# Fender protection 

The idea is to identify objects in the river that could damage the fender like ships.
also another objective is to find unknown objects that our Deep Learning model was not able to identify, which user later would mark as 'Threat'/'Non-Threat'.

## Deep Learning Model

We use the Darknet framework for our Deep Learning Application.

### Model

#### Iteration 1 : 
                  We have 2 classes
                  Base Architecture is of YOLO v3
                  we use coco dataset for transfer Learning
